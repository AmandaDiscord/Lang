/**
 * Export properties are keyed by *CommandGroup* names.
 * Each *CommandGroup* consists of an *Object* filled with *LangCommand*s keyed by command names.
 * A *LangCommand* consists of *Object*s of `prompts` and `returns` and also an *Object* describing it's help meta data.
 *
 * Sub commands of Amanda cannot be modified because of the nature of the code. Example: `&music skip` where "skip"
 * cannot be modified. We might add this functionality at a later date. Most likely not.
 *
 * When describing the types of a command argument, those can be modified. Example: `"usage": "<code>"` where code
 * can be changed if applicable.
 *
 * Wild Cards are a concept used in this module. They are delimited by the percent symbol (%) and tell the code to
 * substitute the words connected to it with information which can only be retrieved by the code because it's dynamic
 *
 * Directly below this statement should be an *Object* titled generic. This contains generic phrases as to not repeat typing.
 * Some languages may not support the same fluidity English has so having this is optional. Just as long as the statement
 * ends up making sense to someone reading it from Discord.
